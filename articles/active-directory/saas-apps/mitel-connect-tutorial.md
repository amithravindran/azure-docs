# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Mitel MiCloud Connect

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Mitel Connect app to integrate Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Mitel MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform. The Mitel Connect app is available in the Azure Gallery. Integrating Azure AD with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control userâ€™s access to MiCloud Connect apps and to CloudLink apps in Azure AD by using their enterprise credentials.
* You can enable users on your account to be automatically signed-in to MiCloud Connect or CloudLink (single sign-on) using their Azure AD accounts.


If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink platform, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription

  If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* A Mitel MiCloud Connect account or Mitel CloudLink Account, depending on the application you want to configure.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on (SSO).

## Adding Mitel Connect from the gallery

To configure the integration of Mitel Connect into Azure AD, you need to add Mitel Connect from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps in the Azure portal.

* The Mitel Connect app supports **SP** initiated single sign-on.

**To add Mitel Connect from the gallery, do the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory**. The **Azure Active Directory** panel opens.

2. In the **Azure Active Directory** panel, select **Enterprise Applications**. The **All Applications** page opens, displaying a list of applications in your Azure AD tenant.

3. Click **New application**. The **Add an application** page opens. 

4. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Mitel Connect** in the **Enter a name** field. Click the **Mitel Connect** application from the results panel, and then click **Add** from the **Add app** panel that opens.


## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform based on a test user named ***Britta Simon***. For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between the user in Azure AD portal and the corresponding user on the Mitel platform. Refer to the following sections for information about configuring and testing Azure AD SSO with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform.

 - **[Configure and test Azure AD SSO with MiCloud Connect](#configure-and-test-azure-ad-sso-with-micloud-connect)**
 - **[Configure and test Azure AD SSO with CloudLink Platform](#configure-and-test-azure-ad-sso-with-cloudlink-platform)**

### Configure and test Azure AD SSO with MiCloud Connect

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with MiCloud Connect, complete the following steps:

1. **[Configure MiCloud Connect for SSO with Azure AD](#configure-micloud-connect-for-single-sign-on-with-azure-ad)** - to enable your users to use this feature and to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD SSO with **Britta Simon**.
3. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable **Britta Simon** to use Azure AD SSO.
4. **[Create a Mitel MiCloud Connect test user](#create-a-mitel-micloud-connect-test-user)** - to create a user for **Britta Simon** in the MiCloud Connect account that is linked to the corresponding user in the Azure AD portal.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

#### Configure MiCloud Connect for single sign-on with Azure AD
